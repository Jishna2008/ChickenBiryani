######Tips

_The first and foremost important thing to take care of while preparing chicken biryani is, always use a heavy-bottomed pan as you would not want the chicken getting cooked._

_If you want your chicken to be juicier in your biryani, do not remove the bone._

_If your cooked rice has turned sticky, spread it on a plate and leave it for 5 minutes. The rice will be separate and fluffy again._

_Freshly pound spices bring out the best taste in Biryani, so make sure that you dry roast all the whole spices for a good 2-3 minutes and then pound or grind them_
